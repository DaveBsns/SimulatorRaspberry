Thursday, 21st March 2024:
- We're going to use a ⁠Miroboard for brainstorming (PB)
- ⁠Github issues for Task management
- ⁠Markdown for documentation
- ⁠Road runner license (DF)
- Demo: ⁠⁠Booting up the simulator in the lab (DF)
- ⁠⁠Basic workflow - work on the personal laptop, push the code, test in the lab, then merge successfully implemented features (DF)

Thursday, 28th March 2024:
- Determine whether to use Roadrunner or just Unity for VR editing using the following questions
1. ⁠What looks better?
2. ⁠What's easier to implement?
3. ⁠Do we have German roads, street signs and bicycle lanes?
- Overview of Unity version control
- Overview of sensor collection scripts
- Discussion of the steering logic: can be improved, but this isn't required in this project

Thursday, 11th April 2024:
- Preparation for intermediate presentation scheduled for April 18

Thu, 30 May 2024

Current State Overview
- Scenario 1: Complete and functional.
- Scenario 1b: Implementation on Unity side is complete; testing on the simulator is pending.
- Scenario 2 & 3 Concepts: Conceptualization is complete.
- Scenario 3: Philipp has begun implementation in Unity.
- Scenario 2: Pooja has begun implementation in Unity.

Goal for End of Semester
- Scenario 1: Ensure it is fully functional, including Scenario 1b to demonstrate a working Rizer.
- Scenario 2: Complete implementation, excluding weather conditions.
- Scenario 3: Complete implementation, excluding weather conditions and limited to basic physics for slow bicyclists.
- Documentation: Prepare and possibly finalize a paper or documentation of the project.
